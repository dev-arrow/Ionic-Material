# Ionic Material
Ionic Material is an extension library for the Ionic Framework, meaning you don't need to change the way you develop your Ionic hybrid apps to have them materialized. Ionic Material aims to integrate the best representations of Material Design into a single add-on library for Ionic Developers. With the Polymer Project, ngMaterial, and other open source projects arising, we aim to be actively engaged and aligned with these, and other, related projects.

As a 100% free open-source project, developer participation is encouraged, as much or little as possible.
