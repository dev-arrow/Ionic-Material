# Ionic Material Experiment
With the increase in interest in this project, I will be providing a major update to this project soon. Please hang tight while I finish writing the directives, API, and complete testing. The goal is for a beta version to be released in April. With some help, we can speed it along.

Ionic material is currently an experimental extension library for the Ionic Framework, meaning you won't change the way you develop your Ionic hybrid apps to have them materialized. Ionic Material aims to integrate the best representations of Material Design into a single add-on library for Ionic Developers. With the Polymer Project, ngMaterial, and other open source projects arising, we aim to be actively engaged and aligned with these, and other, related projects.

As a 100% free open-source project, developer participation is encouraged, as much or little as possible.
